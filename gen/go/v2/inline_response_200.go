 * The Vendor API is available as an alternative to configuring your application via the Vendor website. This API will allow you as the Vendor to manage your apps and app configuration, manage customer licenses, view your private container images.

You can create a new token by clicking the New API Token button in the API Tokens table. You must give this token a nickname before saving.
